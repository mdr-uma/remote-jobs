# Remote Jobs
    This app is for the software engineers who are seeking remote jobs. Due to COVID-19, there are thousands of companies running remotely and I took this as an opportunity to build this application as my final project, which can be beneficial for a lot of software engineers.
  
    This app is listing all the remote jobs, sorted by recent date and it's updating everyday. There is also a search feature where you can search jobs by tags. Please do not add space between words, instead use plus(+) sign in search input.
 
    Users can create accounts to save the jobs they are interested on. One job can be saved only one time. Users who don't have an account can still view all the jobs and apply for it. Actual job links are provided in the list so you can apply it directly from there. Users who have an account will have a private dashboard where all the saved jobs stay safely and once you apply for a job it can be remove from dashboard anytime. I hope this is going to be helpful.
